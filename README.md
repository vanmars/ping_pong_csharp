#### _Classic Ping Pong Programming Exercise, with C#_

#### By _**Vanessa**_

## Description

_This is a project for Epicodus to practice using C# syntax. The original directions from Epicodus include:_

Ping-pong is a classic programming exercise that utilizes branching and looping. Here's how it works:

A user enters a number and the application returns all numbers from 1 to the user input with the following changes:

All numbers divisible by 3 are replaced by "ping".
All numbers divisible by 5 are replaced by "pong"
All numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 are replaced by "ping-pong".
If the user enters 15, the program will return:

1 
2
"ping"
4
"pong"
"ping"
7
8
"ping"
"pong"
11
"ping"
13
14
"ping-pong"

Write a console ping-pong application.

Write plain English spec descriptions first, including both an input and desired output for each behavior.

## Specifications
| Spec     | Behavior | Input    | Output   |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1 | When a user enters a number, the program returns all numbers from 1 to the user input. | 15 | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 |
| 2 | All numbers divisible by 3 are replaced by "ping" | 15 | 1, 2, "ping", 4, 5, "ping", 7, 8, "ping", 10, 11, "ping", 13, 14, "ping" |
| 3 | All numbers divisible by 5 are replaced by "pong" | 15 | 1, 2, "ping", 4, "pong", "ping", 7, 8, "ping", "pong", 11, "ping", 13, 14, "ping" |
| 4 | All numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 are replaced by "ping-pong" | 15 | 1, 2, "ping", 4, "pong", "ping", 7, 8, "ping", "pong", 11, "ping", 13, 14, "ping-pong" |
